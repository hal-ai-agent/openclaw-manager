  "whatItDoes": "Given an agent configuration file, this rig creates a new DigitalOcean droplet, installs OpenClaw, configures channels (Telegram, Gmail), and stores all secrets in 1Password. The manager reads shared secrets (like Anthropic API keys) from 1Password and creates agent-specific entries prefixed with the agent name. After provisioning, the new agent is running and reachable via its configured channels.",
